"Thank you for the reply.

Invaluable advice, I work on problems from the Big(O) Club, even if some take a few hours

I handle A-B in CF Div 3 well. Problem C takes more effort 
due to shaky math skills.

Woud you suggest to go for TLE-eliminators level 1/2? or 
work on my own with codecell's help?
