/*
Monocarp is participating in a programming contest, which features 26
 problems, named from 'A' to 'Z'. The problems are sorted by difficulty.

  Moreover, it's known that Monocarp can solve 
  problem 'A' in 1  minute, 
  problem 'B' in 2 minutes, ..., 
  problem 'Z' in 26 minutes.

After the contest, you discovered his contest log â€” 
a string, consisting of uppercase Latin letters, 
such that the i-th letter 
tells which problem Monocarp was solving during the i-th minute of the contest. 
If Monocarp had spent enough time in total on a problem to solve it, he solved it. 

Note that Monocarp could have been thinking about a problem after solving it.

6
A C B C B C
1 2 3 4 5 6

1 - A at index 1
2 - B at index 5
3 - C at index 6

so just track each alphabet

-take string
-encounter alphabet, store its ascii value but such that a=1, z=26
vector of zero to 27
-counting alphabets to see if we have it stored
-if time spent between previous iteration of that problem exceeds free time then solved


Given Monocarp's contest log, calculate the number of problems he solved during the contest
